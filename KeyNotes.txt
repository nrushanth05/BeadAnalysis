1. Bead Size Analysis (Single Projection)
50-200 beads imaged

1.1 CV<5% (all beads are pretty uniform in size)
20-30 beads sufficient for size analysis

1.2 CV>5% (more variance in size)
need 25-300 additional beads for reliable results

1.3 Dmax > 1000 um -> digital camera -> image analysis software

1.4 200 < Dmax < 1000 um -> digital camera + inverted microscope -> image analysis software

1.5 Dmax < 400 um -> optical microscopy -> image analysis software

2. Bead Shape
2.1 Single projection
2.2 Five projections
2.3 Triple snap Projection
